# PHP-SDK - SmartLink

The Smart-Link technology manages redirects for app users depending on
their device, language and environment settings. The Smart-Link should
be used for all sharing functionality in your app. It offers an easy way
to generate sharing links and some GET-Parameters to modify the
Redirect-Behaviour.

## Getting started

To setup a SmartLink, which is responsible for all your redirects, copy
the `demo/smartlink.php` file to the root folder of your project.


### API / GET-Parameters

You can add all of the listed parameters to the SmartLink Url to modify
the Redirect behaviour.

| Parameter  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Example                                                                                                                                             |

| debug      | Add the debug parameter to disable redirects and show Debug info on the smartlink.php page                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Show the Debug-Page for the SmartLink: https://www.my-web-app.com/smartlink.php?debug=1                                                             |
| device     | To simulate a different device type (mobile, tablet or desktop), just add a device-GET Parameter to your URL. The SmartLink will automatically use this device type then and respond with it. Allowed values are `mobile`, `tablet` and `desktop`.                                                        | Simulate the mobile view of an app: https://www.my-web-app.com/?i_id=1234&device=mobile                                                             |

| website    | If your app is being embedded in a website via iframe, you should add a GET-Parameter called website containing the URL the app is embedded in to your smartlink.php Url.

## Easy parameter passthrough

The SmartLink Technology makes it easy to **pass parameters to your
application** no matter if the application is **embedded via iframe or into
a Facebook Page-Tab**. All GET Parameters passed to your smartlink.php
file will be written to a cookie (Cookie-key aa_1234_smartlink, 1234 is
the instance id of your application). When you initialize the app
manager object in your application again, then all parameters will be
deleted from the cookie and written to the GET parameter again.

So you donâ€™t have to care about that... Pass GET parameters to your
smartlink.php file and expect them in your app target file. :-)


## Embed an App via iframe

>**Warning**
>
>Safari is blocking third-party cookies within iframes! You need to
>assure that users visiting your app will be redirected via SmartLink to
>your application, so the SmartLink can set a cookie as first-party.
>Within the iframe cookies from this domain will be allowed then. DO NOT
>link directly to the page, your app is embedded in.

Always link to the SmartLink redirecting to the page your app is
embedded in. If your app is being embedded in a website via iframe, you
should add a GET-Parameter called website containing the URL the app is
embedded in to your smartlink.php Url. Your users will then be
redirected the Website Url and not directly to your app. This will keep
traffic up on your website. :-)

Use the website-GET Parameter for your iframe-Source is the easiest way
to keep your visitors on the website. The App-Manager SDK automatically
detects website-GET Parameters and set them to a cookie.

Here is an example to embed a photocontest-app to the website
https://www.app-arena.com/fotowettbewerb.html

```html
<iframe src="https://stage.fotowettbewerb.co/?i_id=9713&website=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.app-arena.com%2Ffotowettbewerb.html"
width="100%" height="1200" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
